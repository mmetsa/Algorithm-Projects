# Quaternion operations and conversion

## Quaternion operations, converting strings to Quaternion objects and vice versa

Created a class to represent a [Quaternion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion).

Made various functions that operate with Quaternions. Created Test cases to verify the correctness of the created functions.

The goal of this project was to create a program that people who need to operate with Quaternions can use.


This project required a strong knowledge of string and math operations
