# Comparison of different array sorting methods

## My algorithm to sort an array with binary insertion sort

In this project I made two methods:
* `binarySearch(int[] array, int left, int right, int element)`
* `binaryInsertionSort(int[] a)`

The first method finds the index of an element in a sorted array.

The second method sorts an array using binary search.

This class also contains several different array sorting methods and the main program compares the speed of these methods.
