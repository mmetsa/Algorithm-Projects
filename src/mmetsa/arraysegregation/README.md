# Array sorting task
## An algorithm that receives an array of 2 types of objects and sorts it in linear time.

In this project I made a method `reorder(Animal[] animal)` where the given array contains _Animal_ objects: either _Sheep_ or _Goat_.

The method sorts the array in linear time - All of the _Goat_ objects before the _Sheep_ objects.
