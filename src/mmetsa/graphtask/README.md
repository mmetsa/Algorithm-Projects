# Bellman-Ford algorithm

##My implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path between two given Vertices in the Graph.

This code also contains different methods from other students.

Methods created by me:
* `List<Arc> BellmanFord(Vertex startVertex, Vertex endVertex, boolean shouldValidateGraph) {
  checkBasicErrors(startVertex, endVertex)`
* `checkBasicErrors(Vertex startVertex, Vertex endVertex)`
* `boolean canTravelFromStartToEndVertex(Vertex startVertex, Vertex endVertex)`
* `checkIfGraphIsSimple()`
* `resetVerticesInfo()`

Detailed information about these methods can be read from these methods' Javadoc

This project was considered 26 hours of academic work. The project included a collaboration with team members to structure
our code and refactor it by finding common methods.

Test cases were written to verify the created methods.
