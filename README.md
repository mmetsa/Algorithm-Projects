# This repository contains work for my university course 
## ICD0001 - Algorithms and Data Structures

This purpose of this course was to familiarize us with different sorting and searching algorithms and data structures.

Java was used throughout this course to implement these different algorithms, but these algorithms can also be
implemented in different programming languages, the idea is the same.

### What I learned

* Using Git
* String manipulation
* Solving Graph tasks
* Most widely known search & sorting algorithms
* Different data structures implementations
    * Node trees
    * Lists, LinkedLists, Maps, Queues, Stacks, Heaps
    * Graphs
* Writing unit tests
